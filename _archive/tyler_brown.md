Tyler is an artist and participatory experience designer, focused on creating a tactile and visceral experience for players in all forms of immersive environments. They have worked extensively in theater and film arts and bring a breadth of experience to transformational media. They have been a larper for over twenty years and have a range of experience creating, running, and designing games. 

Professionally, Tyler spends most of their time as a music producer, as well as an events manager locally in Boston and has found their jobs tend to cross-pollinate skill sets. Creating brand new experiences and opening up larping to those who have never experienced its joys is something they care deeply about.
