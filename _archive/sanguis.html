      <h2>Sanguis</h2>
      
      <p><em>Sanguis</em> is a larp vampire setting that reimagines the classic vampire myths from around the world. <em>Sanguis</em> is about the experiences of vampires who live on the fringes of human society and are the subject of human prejudices. The larp will begin with an online experience in 2021, and once it is safe to interact in person, continue with events after that in a world that will grow to encompass a rich story.</p>
      
      <p><em>Sanguis</em> is an exploration into what it means to be an outsider to the human condition. A central theme of the larp is the question of what it means to surrender to an alien entity, and the experience includes some elements of body horror. What does your new reality of eternal survival mean while you struggle to fit in with the norms of humanity? </p>
