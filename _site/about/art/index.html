	<h2 id="our-art">Our Art</h2>

<p>Since 2016, Reverie Studios has created high-quality, immersive live-action roleplaying (larp) events where participants actively engage in storytelling by embodying unique personas. Prioritizing participant-driven narratives, Reverie collaborates with attendees to develop characters and scenes, providing tools and support to ensure meaningful and impactful experiences.</p>

<p>Reverie Studios specializes in Nordic-style larps, emphasizing immersive, collaborative, and artistic storytelling. Based in Greater Boston, the studio has hosted events worldwide, tailoring venues and narratives for maximum immersion. Reverie focuses on participant-driven experiences that explore themes like grief, authority, and existential questions.</p>

<h3 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h3>

<p><strong>What is larp?</strong> A mix of live-action roleplay and immersive theater, where participants shape the story. Reverie prioritizes narrative control over game mechanics to foster emotional and thematic depth.</p>

<p><strong>What kinds of larps do you create?</strong> Intense, artistic larps with themes of reality, grief, and responsibility, inspired by Nordic larp traditions.</p>

<p><strong>Experience?</strong> Since 2016, Reverie has designed a wide range of events, backed by a team with over 20 years of expertise in large-scale and intricate larp storytelling.</p>

<p><strong>Why larp?</strong> Reverie aims to elevate larp in the U.S. and collaborate internationally to create meaningful, high-quality events. The studio has contributed to notable projects like End of the Line in Berlin, Saturnalia in New Orleans, and actively partners with global creators such as Chaos League for international runs of larps.</p>

<h3 id="ethics">Ethics</h3>

<p>Reverie Studios values diversity, safety, and shared storytelling, fostering compassion and inclusion in all its activities.</p>

<p><strong>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</strong><br />
Reverie Studios is committed to supporting LGBTQIA+ rights, BIPOC representation, womenâ€™s rights, and inclusion for marginalized communities. The studio actively opposes white supremacy and promotes diversity, safety, and collaboration. The studio integrates these principles into its work, offering scholarships, and inclusive opportunities to underrepresented voices in larp (live-action role-playing) design and events.</p>

<p><strong>Code of Conduct</strong><br />
Reverie Studios ensures a safe, respectful, and lawful environment at its events. Harassment, intolerance, and disruptive behavior are strictly prohibited. Violations may lead to removal without a refund, with RS staff authorized to enforce these rules as necessary. Attendees are expected to separate in-character drama from real-life interactions. For more, see our <a href="/about/conduct/">detailed Code of Conduct policy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-Harassment Policy</strong><br />
RS events maintain a harassment-free environment, protecting participants regardless of identity, appearance, or beliefs. Harassment includes offensive comments, stalking, unwelcome attention, or disruptive behavior. Violators may be expelled without a refund. Participants are encouraged to report any issues, with RS staff ready to assist in ensuring safety and comfort.</p>

<p><strong>Health &amp; Safety Updates</strong><br />
Health policies will be updated as needed to protect all participants. Compliance is required.</p>
