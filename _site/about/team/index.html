		<p>Ken is an avid gamer, be it board, roleplaying, card, video, or Live Action/larp. He got his start working in boffer experiences, initially with Lione (which he helped transition to a non-profit), and then eventually helping produce Occam’s Razor with Darksteel Games. However, Ken most enjoys writing collaborative experiences or participating in more freeform larps.</p>

<p>By day, Ken is an engineer by training and the VP of Engineering at Starburst Data, where he’s responsible for a large engineering group spanning the world. He is adept at running complex projects with a myriad of moving parts, and shines in operationally complex situations.</p>

<p>His ambition is to write stories that people love to immerse themselves in, and explore topics they would not otherwise encounter in their everyday lives.</p>

			<h4>Christopher Eaton</h4>
			<ul class="staff-info">
				<li>Operations</li>

		<p>Chris has been roleplaying and telling stories for over 30 years at the local and national level, spanning various organizations and troupe games. Originally cutting his teeth in the tabletop realm like so many others, he still enjoys rules-heavy board games to this day, which by his admission, “Aren’t fun to play.” In recent years, he’s transitioned primarily to partaking and designing larps, most prominently those of the Nordic variety, where mechanics are not essential, and the participants are in the driver’s seat of the narrative.</p>

<p>In his professional life, Chris is an entrepreneur and tech industry consultant, focusing on legal and government environments. In his spare time, when not teaching Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, he enjoys cooking, as well as making music. Chris takes great pride in his ability to provide Reverie Studios his own brand of organization and urgency, as well as an exceptional clarity of purpose.</p>

<p>As a well-traveled United States Marine Corps combat veteran, and former Department of Defense paramilitary contractor, he enjoys weaving in gallows humor with high intensity events that reflect his own experiences. Projects which he enjoys the most mirrors his own penchant for gritty horror and grueling decision making.</p>
