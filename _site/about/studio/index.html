	<h2 id="our-vision">Our Vision</h2>

<p>Reverie is a participatory experience design agency based in Boston, MA that produces educational and fun co-creative immersive events, generally known as ‘larping’ or ‘live action roleplaying events’. Participants take on a persona and engage with the story directly and form strong ties to the events going on, rather than watching passively.</p>

<h2 id="our-ethos">Our Ethos</h2>

<p>Reverie believes that the stories that are generated within the larp by the participants are more important than the story that Reverie would tell. Participants and organizers collaborate to develop character and scene sketches, and then Reverie assists the participants to express themselves during the event. Reverie aims to provide all of the tools we can to assist participants in having a meaningful and impactful story experience.</p>

<h2 id="our-story">Our Story</h2>

<p>Reverie Studios began in 2016 with small, bespoke larp events. Since then the studio has run or hosted half a dozen larp events ranging from intimate and intense affairs to large scale blockbuster style events. Reverie continues to grow and explore new larp formats and experiences, with plans on the horizon to partner with other organizations and run even more events.</p>

		<p>Garett is a writer and participatory experience designer, deeply invested in the concepts of collaborative and immersive techniques. He has written a number of different kinds of games and larps, including: ‘Age of Iron’, an experimental fantasy production that implemented myth creation with a decentralized structure to allow participants to explore stories that were interesting to them, rather than any pre-written experience.</p>

<p>By profession, Garett is an administrative manager and has an MBA in ‘Sustainable Organization and Development’, with a focus on employee-ownership and fair business practice. His professional career has given him opportunities to work with health research, renewable energy, and community projects.</p>

<p>Garett hopes to provide experiences for others that allow them to engage with stories in a very personal way, allowing an opportunity for event participants to change their perspectives on life.</p>

		<p>Ken is an avid gamer, be it board, roleplaying, card, video, or Live Action/larp. He got his start working in boffer experiences, initially with Lione (which he helped transition to a non-profit), and then eventually helping produce Occam’s Razor with Darksteel Games. However, Ken most enjoys writing collaborative experiences or participating in more freeform larps.</p>

<p>By day, Ken is an engineer by training and the VP of Engineering at Starburst Data, where he’s responsible for a large engineering group spanning the world. He is adept at running complex projects with a myriad of moving parts, and shines in operationally complex situations.</p>

<p>His ambition is to write stories that people love to immerse themselves in, and explore topics they would not otherwise encounter in their everyday lives.</p>

		<p>Tyler is an artist and participatory experience designer, focused on creating a tactile and visceral experience for players in all forms of immersive environments. He has worked extensively in theater and film arts and brings a breath of experience to transformational media. He has been a larper for over twenty years and has a breadth of experience creating, running, and designing games.</p>

<p>Professionally, Tyler spends most of his time as a music producer, as well as an events manager locally in Boston and has found his jobs tend to cross-pollinate skill sets. Creating brand new experiences and opening up larping to those who have never experienced its joys is something he cares deeply about.</p>

<h2 id="collaborators">Collaborators</h2>

<p>At Reverie Studios we believe in cooperative production and collaboration, and as such we have worked with a number of individuals and organizations to create art. Often, these artists are those who want to see this kind of theater thrive and have given us their services free or at reduced rates. We would like to promote them and to showcase their work, and if you are interested in them to visit their pages.</p>
