	<h2 id="our-vision">Our Vision</h2>

<p>Reverie is a participatory experience design agency based in Boston, MA that produces educational and fun co-creative immersive events, generally known as ‘larping’ or ‘live action roleplaying events’. Participants take on a persona and engage with the story directly and form strong ties to the events going on, rather than watching passively.</p>

<h2 id="our-story">Our Story</h2>

<p>Tyler, Ken and Garett have known each other for years, but recently decided that rather than participating in their passions through the experience produced by others, that they would seek to create experiences on their own. After Grand Masquerade in New Orleans 2016, they resolved to forge a new group with a new purpose in their hometown of Boston.</p>

		<p>Garett is a writer and participatory experience designer, deeply invested in the concepts of collaborative and immersive techniques. He has written a number of different kinds of games and larps, including: ‘Age of Iron’, an experimental fantasy production that implemented myth creation with a decentralized structure to allow participants to explore stories that were interesting to them, rather than any pre-written experience.</p>

<p>By profession, Garett is an administrative manager and has an MBA in ‘Sustainable Organization and Development’, with a focus on employee-ownership and fair business practice. His professional career has given him opportunities to work with health research, renewable energy, and community projects.</p>

<p>Garett hopes to provide experiences for others that allow them to engage with stories in a very personal way, allowing an opportunity for event participants to change their perspectives on life.</p>

		<p>Tyler is an artist and participatory experience designer, focused on creating a tactile and visceral experience for players in all forms of immersive environments. He has worked extensively in theater and film arts and brings a breath of experience to transformational media. He has been a larper for over twenty years and has breadth both creating, running and designing games.</p>

<p>Professionally, Tyler spends most of his time designing props and building sets for stage production and films and has found both of his jobs tend to cross-pollinate skill sets. Creating brand new experiences and opening up larping to those who have never experienced it’s joys is something he deeply cares about.</p>

<h2 id="collaborators">Collaborators</h2>

<p>At Reverie Studios we believe in cooperative production and collaboration, and as such we have worked with a number of individuals and organizations to create art. Often, these artists are those who want to see this kind of theater thrive and have given us their services free or at reduced rates. We would like to promote them and to showcase their work, and if you are interested in them to visit their pages.</p>
