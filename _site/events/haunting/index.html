	<p>Any questions you have about event logistics not covered here should be addressed to <a href = "mailto:hello@reverie.studio">hello@reverie.studio</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Schedule</h3>
	
	<p>October 23rd through the 25th, 2020. The larp event starts at 11 AM on <strong>Saturday, October 24th</strong> and runs all day. The 23rd and 25th are dedicated to social activities and other fun side offerings.</p>

	<p>The event schedule is currently under active development. More details will be posted here as Gray Manor draws near.</p>

	<h3>Venue</h3>
	
	<p>The main events of <em>Gray Manor</em> will be held at the Cambridge Masonic Temple. This beautiful and historic location at 1950 Massachusetts Avenue in Porter Square, Cambridge, has served as a vibrant community center since 1910. The Cambridge Masonic Temple is a Georgian Monumental style structure, constructed in 1910 with Craftsman interior appointments typical of the period. To be able to use this historic space for such a unique immersive event is an honor and will amplify the atmosphere of <em>Gray Manor</em>.</p>
	
	<h3>Accommodations</h3>
	<h4>The City of Cambridge</h4>
	
	<p>We want our attendees to think of this weekend as a unique vacation experience with the <em>Gray Manor</em> larp as its centerpiece. The event schedule leaves ample time to explore the city of Cambridge and Boston and its many attractions. This event's venue at the Cambridge Masonic Temple means it is highly accessible on the Boston Transit network, and it is within view from the front door of the Porter Square subway station.</p>
	
	<h4>Hotel</h4>
	
	<p>While this larp does not include in its ticket price any lodging, there is a hotel immediately next door to the event venue that offers group rates, and the entirety of the city will be available with suggestions on other nearby hotels and lodging options.</p>

	<h4>Transportation</h4>
	
	<p><em>Gray Manor</em> will be held at 1950 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02140 at the Cambridge Masonic Temple. This location is ideal as it is near to a number of different transportation options, including the Boston subway system. The Porter Square station is a major hub that is located near to the exciting Davis and Harvard Square areas, which have a variety of dining options, refreshments, and social areas.</p>
	
	<p>The Logan International Airport serves Boston's flight based needs, as well as the Manchester NH Airport, and both are close enough to be used for any travel in. If traveling from Logan, Cambridge is easy to get into via taxi, ride hailing services such as Lyft or Uber, and via the subway system.</p>
	
	<p>Cambridge is a very walkable city, and rental bikes are also available!</p>
