      <h2>The Hard Way</h2>
      <h3>October 20-22, 2023</h3>
      
      <p>Reverie Studios proudly presents <em>The Hard Way</em>: a larp set in the dying days of the Crash Wrestling Alliance, a fictional  independent wrestling promotion. Participants will step into the strange, seedy, incomparable world of professional wrestling&ndash;exploring the lives of their characters both inside the ring, and behind the curtain. As CWA prepares for its last-ever live event, characters face a decision about their futures: will they relocate to keep chasing the dream, or is it time to close the book on this part of their lives?</p>
