<h2 id="2021-and-beyond">2021 and Beyond</h2>

<p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its social distancing measures made it impossible for us at Reverie Studios to put on the types of events that we so love. But this has given us time to incubate a large number of ideas for 2021 and beyond!</p>

<p><em><a href="/events/haunting/">The Haunting of Gray Manor</a></em> has been tentatively rescheduled for October 8–10, 2021. The COVID-necessitated delay gave us time to reconsider the event’s scope and logistics. We are increasing the number of possible attendees to 80, and applications are once again open! The <a href="/events/haunting/">event website</a> now also has a trailer video and an interview with our sound designer, Nathan Leigh.</p>

<p><em><a href="/events/sanguis/">Sanguis</a></em> is a vampiric larp that will start online and then transition to live events (or at least, undead ones) when possible. Late 2021 will also feature Miranda Dawn Chadbourne’s <em><a href="/events/ember/">Ember</a></em> and <em><a href="/events/fools/">Fools Rush In</a></em>.</p>

<p>And we even have one event on the calendar for 2022. <em><a href="/events/hardway">The Hard Way</a></em> will be set during the final event of the fictitious Crash Wrestling Alliance, following the onstage and backstage lives of its performers and crew.</p>

<h2 id="about-reverie-studios">About Reverie Studios</h2>

<h3 id="our-vision">Our Vision</h3>

<p>Reverie is a participatory experience design agency based in Boston, MA that produces educational and fun co-creative immersive events, generally known as ‘larping’ or ‘live action roleplaying events’. Participants take on a persona and engage with the story directly and form strong ties to the events going on, rather than watching passively.</p>

<h3 id="our-story">Our Story</h3>

<p>Reverie Studios began in 2016 with small, bespoke larp events. Since then the studio has run or hosted half a dozen larp events ranging from intimate and intense affairs to large scale blockbuster style events. Reverie continues to grow and explore new larp formats and experiences, with plans on the horizon to partner with other organizations and run even more events.</p>
