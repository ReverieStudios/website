<p><em>Reverie Presents</em> is a free-form, collaborative group hosted by Reverie Studios. <em>Reverie Presents</em> will host, run and promote one off-larp evenings in Boston. <em>Reverie Presents</em> is a showcase for parlor or smaller scale larps, promoting the art form for those familiar as well as new to it.</p>

<p><em>Reverie Presents</em> was started as a way to expose people to larping as an art form and to promote designers. It is an opportunity to attend with low stakes as it is free with minimal pre-time investment. It runs semi-frequently based on availability of the site and those looking to run events.</p>
