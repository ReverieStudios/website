      <p>It is 1984. While demagogues peddle nationalist falsehoods on the international stage in the shadow of nuclear annihilation, a secretive and forgotten government program called ‘Project Chalice’ is about to pierce the veil to extra dimensional worlds and horrors. Under the guidance of the unstable Dr. Leighton Hooke, the program which hosts the remaining vestiges of classified research projects from the Cold War is on the edge about to tilt over into the alien unknown. This larp will be about the final days of the program before Dr. Hooke transforms himself and bends the secretive group into a cult and corporation bearing his new name: ProGenus.
