      <p>An exploration of desperation, belief, and the search for something larger than the self. Step into the late 1970s&mdash;a time of transformation, upheaval, and the relentless pursuit of meaning.</p> 
      
      <p>At the height of the self-improvement movement, amidst a swirling mix of human potential seminars, self-empowerment retreats, and esoteric whispers of cosmic truth, Convolution invites you to join The Convergence, a weekend-long experience promising to help you seize your destiny. Led by a magnetic, enigmatic figure, The Convergence is an intricate tapestry woven from countless philosophies and techniques, from modern psychology to ancient wisdom. For some, it&rsquo;s a chance to deepen their connection and spread the truth to others. For others, it&rsquo;s a return&mdash;an attempt to break through lingering barriers in the hopes of finding salvation, empowerment, or something far more personal. For newcomers, it&rsquo;s a leap of faith, brought here by loved ones or curiosity.</p>

      <p>But what if there&rsquo;s more? What if the leader sees something larger, something beyond you, and this seminar is only the surface of something unfathomable? What lines will you cross to be part of the bigger picture&mdash;or escape from it? This is a Pattern Seeker larp: a world where belief and perception shape reality, where small clues might unravel cosmic truths, and where every choice builds toward a climactic revelation. Expect moments of psychological intensity, collaboration, and suspense, as well as themes of ambition, identity, and the fragility of trust. Come seek. Come surrender. Come awaken. This is Convolution. Spring 2026.</p>
