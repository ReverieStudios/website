      <p>In Fracture, you'll experience a weekend-long Nordic larp experience that merges splatterpunk and psychological horror, to be run at Ye Olde Commons, in Charlton, Massachusetts, <strong>Labor Day Weekend, August 30th - September 1st 2024</strong>. It is set in the extended universe of Reverie Studioâ€™s premier blockbuster event <a href = "/events/eskhaton/"><em>Eskhaton</em></a>, and features cultists lurking in the foreboding woods waiting to convert unsuspecting campers, in a cosmic horror setting. Participants will be campers and cultists, with campers dying and becoming cultists.</p>
