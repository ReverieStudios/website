      <h2>Ember</h2>
      
      <p><em>Ember</em> is the burned out remains of a war torn city. The fighting has moved on, but the conflicts remain. The people of Ember are tasked to rebuild and repair: not only their city, but their families, and themselves. Tonight marks the fifth anniversary of when the armies marched through the streets of Ember. Tonight you keep a tradition and light the candles to the lives lost.</p>
      
      <p><em>Ember</em> is an immersive two-day experience for 40 participants. The experience is &ldquo;mechanic lite&rdquo; and &ldquo;story heavy&rdquo;.
