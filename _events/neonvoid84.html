      <p>Experience a descent into the depths of cosmic horror in the shadow of the Cold War with <em>ProGenus &lsquo;84</em>, a Nordic larp about the founding of a twisted science cult&mdash;in the pursuit of the unknown, how far are you willing to go?</p>
      
      <img src = "/i/events/neonvoid84/neon2.jpeg" />
      
      <p>In <em>ProGenus &lsquo;84</em>, you'll experience a weekend-long Nordic larp experience that merges cosmic horror and twisted science, to be run in later 2026. Set in the extended universe of Reverie Studio&rsquo;s premier blockbuster event <em><a href = "/events/eskhaton/">Eskhaton</a></em>, and features scientists and clandestine researchers about to encounter the unknown dimensions, in a cosmic horror setting. Participants will be those researchers who were there in 1984 when a cult was founded after touching the alien unknown and they will explore their transition.</p>
