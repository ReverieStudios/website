## About Reverie Studios

### Our Vision

Reverie is a participatory experience design agency that produces educational and fun co-creative immersive events, generally known as 'larping' or 'live action roleplaying events'. Participants take on a persona and engage with the story directly and form strong ties to the events going on, rather than watching the drama passively from their seats.

### Our Story

Tyler, Ken and Garett have known each other for years, but recently decided that rather than participating in their passions through the experience produced by others, that they would seek to create experiences on their own. After Grand Masquerade in New Orleans 2016, they resolved to forge a new group with a new purpose in their hometown of Boston.
