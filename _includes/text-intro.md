## A Year in Reflection, and Looking Ahead
2024 was a busy year for Reverie Studios! *[Fracture]*, set in the *[Eskhaton]* universe, was a huge success. Future Reverie larps will elaborate and expand on the *Eskhaton* setting. 

### Upcoming Events

In 2025 Reverie Studios is partnering with [Chaos League] to bring the North American run of the critically acclaimed *[Miskatonic University]* to Bryn Mawr in Philadelphia, PA. We are also working on a number of other projects, including a limited small-form larp: *[Convolution]*, an *Eskhaton*-set, mind-warping encounter in the drug-addled &rsquo;70s.

In 2026 Reverie will run a large-scale blockbuster event yet again! This project will either be a new run of *Eskhaton*, rebooted with new material, or a completely new project: [*ProGenus â€˜84*][progenus], about the birth of a science cult in the shadow of the Cold War.

Reverie Studios is also in final playtesting and review of a tabletop roleplaying game based on *[Eskhaton]*, where players take on the roles of cultists in the final days before the arrival of the apocalypse. Intended for lightweight, quick pick-up-and-play with narrative depth, the *Eskhaton* TTRPG is an exciting expansion of Reverie as a design studio.
