## A Year in Reflection, and Looking Ahead
2024 was a busy year as Reverie Studios ran the successful event *[Fracture]*, set in the *[Eskhaton]* universe. A launch point for the revamped *Eskhaton* setting, the studio is embarking on a new era where we align our larps to this cosmic horror universe and expand on it. Our experience with the subject matter also leads us to future opportunities coming in 2024 and 2025!

### 2024

In 2024 Reverie Studios is partnering with [Chaos League] to bring the North American run of the critically acclaimed *[Miskatonic University]* to Bryn Mawr in Philadelphia, PA. This is Reverie Studios second collaboration after running the largescale vampire larp *[Saturnalia]* with By Night Studios in New Orleans’ French Quarter.

Reverie’s primary focus is on *Miskatonic University* in 2024, providing logistical support and consultation for the Italy-based Chaos League. However, the studio is working on a number of seed projects including a limited small-form larp Convolution, about a mind-warping encounter in the drug-addled 70’s, set in the *Eskhaton* universe, and expanding focus on our bespoke character creation system “TBD”.

Reverie Studios is also embarked on the final playtesting and review of a tabletop roleplaying game based on *Eskhaton*, where players take on the roles of cultists in the final days before the arrival of the apocalypse. Intended for light-weight, quick pick-up-and-play with narrative depth, the *Eskhaton* TTRPG is an exciting expansion of Reverie as a design studio.

### 2025

In 2025 Reverie will return to form in the running of a large-scale blockbuster event yet again! Internally, this project will either be a new run of *Eskhaton*, rebooted with the new material, or a completely new project: [*ProGenus ‘84*][progenus], about the birth of a science cult in the shadow of the Cold War.
