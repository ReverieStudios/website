## 2021 and Beyond

*[The Haunting of Gray Manor][haunting]* is set for October 8--10, 2021. The COVID-necessitated delay gave us time to reconsider the event's scope and logistics, and we're looking forward to having sixty attendees!

*[Sanguis][sanguis]* is a vampiric larp that will start online and then transition to live events (or at least, undead ones) when possible. Late 2021 will also feature Miranda Dawn Chadbourne's *[Ember][ember]* and *[Fools Rush In][fools]*.

And we even have one event on the calendar for 2022. *[The Hard Way][hardway]* will be set during the final event of the fictitious Crash Wrestling Alliance, following the onstage and backstage lives of its performers and crew.
