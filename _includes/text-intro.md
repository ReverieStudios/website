## The Pause Before the Neon Storm

In 2026, Reverie Studios will return to form running a large-scale blockbuster event of its own yet again! August 7th-9th, 2026 will herald the dawning of a new horror: [NEON VOID 1984][neon], a larp about the birth of a cosmic horror science cult in the shadow of the Cold War set against the backdrop of the neon &rsquo;80s. [Tickets] go on sale in early September, 2025 so join us for an unforgettable experience!

The studio is also working on a number of side projects including:

* [Convolution][Convolution]: a limited small-form larp about a mind-warping encounter in the drug-addled 70â€™s, set in the [Eskhaton] universe.
* Expanding quality of life features and enhancements for our character creation system.
* A tabletop adaptation of our [Eskhaton] setting, where players take on the roles of cultists in the final days before the arrival of the apocalypse. Intended for light-weight, quick pick-up-and-play with narrative depth, the Eskhaton TTRPG is an exciting new foray for Reverie as a design studio.

### 2025

In 2025, Reverie Studios partnered with [Chaos League] to bring two sold-out runs in North American of the critically acclaimed [Miskatonic University] at Bryn Mawr in Philadelphia, PA. This was Reverie Studios second collaboration after running the large scale vampire larp [Saturnalia] with By Night Studios in New Orleans's famed French Quarter.
