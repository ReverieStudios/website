## Summer 2023 Updates!

Reverie Studios is thrilled to announce that we are currently planning our next horror larp, *[Fracture][fracture]*. Set in the *[Eskhaton][eskhaton]* universe, *Fracture* will delve into a struggle for survival between summer campers and the eerie cult in the nearby woods. Mark your calendars for September 30th, 2024, and in the meantime, take our [interest survey][survey]!

Unfortunately, we've had to put our wrestling larp, *The Hard Way*, on the back burner for now, but if this is a larp you'd like to play in the future, reach out and [let us know][contact]!

Last November, *[Saturnalia][saturnalia]* took the famed French Quarter by storm! This blockbuster collaboration between Reverie Studios and By Night Studios brought two hundred attendees together for a night of larp mayhem in New Orleans. Thank you to everyone, attendees and staff alike, who made this a truly unforgettable experience. For more details about *Saturnalia*, check out its [event page][saturnalia].

We're also in the early stages of planning several events into 2024 and 2025, including *[Eskhaton II][eskhaton]*, *[ProGenus 1984][progenus]*, and *[Azimuth Unknown][azimuth]*.
