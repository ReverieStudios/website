## Gray Manor was a blast!

*[The Haunting of Gray Manor][haunting]* has come and gone, and what a weekend! Thank you to the more than 60 attendees who made this larp a fun, freaky, and thrilling night to remember.

Looking ahead to 2022, Reverie Studios is pleased to announce *[Saturnalia][saturnalia]*, a collaboration between Reverie and By Night Studios. This blockbuster larp will bring the World of Darkness to New Orleans as never before! Tickets available now!

And keep a lookout for *[The Hard Way][hardway]*, which will be set during the final event of the fictitious Crash Wrestling Alliance, following the onstage and backstage lives of its performers and crew.
