## 2021 and Beyond

### The Haunting of Gray Manor

Rescheduled to October 9th, 2021 due to ongoing social distancing measures. However, we have determined that this event, when it occurs, can handle more players, so we are now accepting applications! [Apply today][haunting]! 

### The Hard Way

A wrestling larp coming in 2022! Participants will step into the strange, seedy, incomparable world of professional wrestling - exploring the lives of their characters both inside the ring, and behind the curtain.
