#### Reverie Studios's larp 'A CoG in the Machine' 2<sup>nd</sup> run in October at High Level Games Conference

A larp about what happens when disaster strikes and people take over as the government, [*A CoG in the Machine*][acog] is a larp that Reverie Studios is running again at [High Level Games Conference][hlg] for a larger group and calibrated based on responses to our first run (May 2018 at [Living Games Conference][lgc]). Standing for 'Continuity of Governance', this larp assumes the participants are those that inherit responsibility and must make difficult decisions about what to do when there is no other authority. Check out [*A CoG in the Machine*][acog] as Reverie Studio's 'Marquee' larp event at HLG Con, and also check out [*Pandaemonium*][panda], a collaborative six-studio larp being run for the first time at HLG Con that Reverie is helping to write!
