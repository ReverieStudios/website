## 2021 and Beyond

*[The Haunting of Gray Manor][haunting]* is set for October 8--10, 2021. The COVID-necessitated delay gave us time to reconsider the event's scope and logistics, and we're looking forward to having sixty attendees!

We even have two events on the calendar for 2022. *[The Hard Way][hardway]* will be set during the final event of the fictitious Crash Wrestling Alliance, following the onstage and backstage lives of its performers and crew. 

*[Saturnalia][saturnalia]*, a collaboration between Reverie and By Night Studios, will bring the World of Darkness to New Orleans in a blockbuster-scale larp!
