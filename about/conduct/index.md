## Code of Conduct

Reverie Studios, LLC ("RS") seeks to promote a safe and comfortable environment for its events that can be enjoyed by all the players and staff. To that end, we have established this Code of Conduct, to which we expect all attendees and staff to adhere.

RS expects our customers, players, and staff members to behave in an appropriate, mature, and responsible manner. We expect common sense to rule and for everyone involved to have a general sense of the safety and well-being of those around them. Customers, players, and staff members are expected to treat others with courtesy and respect. Harassment or intolerance is unacceptable.

All customers, players, and staff members are expected to abide by the laws of the land---including federal, state, and local laws, statutes, ordinances, etc.  

While we understand that the nature of roleplay and acting will create in-character drama, we do not expect for this drama and any hurt feelings to spill over into the realm of out-of-character interactions. Leave the drama for your character; do not bring it into real life.

RS management or authorized staff may remove attendees from a RS event for any reason. We will endeavor to provide a verbal warning to you and allow you to correct your behavior before removing you from the event, when appropriate. There may be times when we immediately remove an attendee when it is determined that such removal is in the best interest of RS, our attendees, the hosting space, or the general public. While we hope that the reason for immediate removal would be obvious, we are under no obligation to disclose the reason for removal. If you are removed from the event, you will not be entitled to a refund in any way.

While not exclusive, the following list provides examples of behaviors or actions that may constitute your immediate removal from a RS event:

* Violating any laws
* Failure to comply with RS or event space staff instructions
* Physically destructive behavior
* Endangering the safety of yourself or others
* Cheating, threatening, or harassing others
* Drinking alcohol if under the age of 21 or facilitating the drinking of alcohol for the same
* Failure to abide by event location or event rules or safety guidelines
* Disruption of the event
* Violation of the RS Anti-Harassment Policy (see below)

Incidents that violate this Code of Conduct should be reported to RS management or authorized staff. RS will make reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of those reporting incidents, when requested. Please be aware that RS staff may need to provide information to authorities in the case of violations of the law.

RS may modify this Code of Conduct from time to time. We will notify you of changes by posting changes here, or by other appropriate means. Any changes to the Code of Conduct will become effective when the updated policy is made publicly available or announced. Your use of our services or attendance at any of our events indicates your acceptance of this Code of Conduct.

### Updates:

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 health emergency, Reverie will be instituting and revisiting policies to protect the health and wellbeing of all participants, staff and visitors. All attendees will be expected to follow these procedures as part of their participation.

## Anti-Harassment Policy

### The Quick Version

Our larp is dedicated to providing harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Larp participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from any RS event without a refund at the discretion of the RS organizers.

### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography, or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the RS staff may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the RS staff immediately. Our staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.

Our larp staff will be happy to help participants contact event space/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance and safety.

**We expect participants to follow these rules at the production, on our Facebook groups, in communication with other players regarding the game,  and at workshops.**
