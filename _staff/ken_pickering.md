Ken is an avid gamer, be it board, roleplaying, card, video or Live Action/LARP. He has assisted running several larp campaigns in the Boston area, including the successful conspiracy/horror game *Occam's Razor*.

By day, Ken is an engineer by training and the Director of Engineering for Hopper, where he's responsible for web/mobile engineering for their large e-commerce platform. He is adept at running complex projects with a myriad of moving parts, and is an inspiring leader to those that work with him.

His ambition is to write stories that people love to immerse themselves in, and explore topics they would not otherwise encounter in their everyday lives.
