Ken is an avid gamer, be it board, roleplaying, card, video, or Live Action/larp. He got his start working in boffer experiences, initially with Lione (which he helped transition to a non-profit), and then eventually helping produce Occamâ€™s Razor with Darksteel Games. However, Ken most enjoys writing collaborative experiences or participating in more freeform larps.

By day, Ken is an engineer by training and the VP of Engineering at Starburst Data, where he's responsible for a large engineering group spanning the world. He is adept at running complex projects with a myriad of moving parts, and shines in operationally complex situations.

His ambition is to write stories that people love to immerse themselves in, and explore topics they would not otherwise encounter in their everyday lives.
