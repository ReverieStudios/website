Taylor is an event planner, technical director, stage manager and production manager in and around the Boston area- working on theater, events, dance, opera and other less qualifiable events.

In 2017, Taylor launched TH.ESP Event Safety Planning, a production consulting business which focuses on safety planning for small theater and independent live events.  

He is a member of USITT and the Event Safety Alliance, a trained COVID Compliance Officer, and a proud new father. In his spare time he works as a Disaster and Sheltering volunteer for the Red Cross.

Taylor has been a board and role-playing gamer almost as long as he's been involved in theater--and is excited to work with Reverie in bringing intense and personal experiences to life.
