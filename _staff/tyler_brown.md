Tyler is an artist and participatory experience designer, focused on creating a tactile and visceral experience for players in all forms of immersive environments. He has worked extensively in theater and film arts and brings a breath of experience to transformational media. He has been a larper for over twenty years and has a breadth of experience creating, running, and designing games. 

Professionally, Tyler spends most of his time as a music producer, as well as an events manager locally in Boston and has found his jobs tend to cross-pollinate skill sets. Creating brand new experiences and opening up larping to those who have never experienced its joys is something he cares deeply about.
