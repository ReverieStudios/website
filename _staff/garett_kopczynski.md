Garett is a writer and participatory experience designer, deeply invested in the concepts of collaborative and immersive techniques. He has written a number of different kinds of games and larps, including: 'Age of Iron', an experimental fantasy production that implemented myth creation with a decentralized structure to allow participants to explore stories that were interesting to them, rather than any pre-written experience.

By profession, Garett is an administrative manager and has an MBA in 'Sustainable Organization and Development', with a focus on employee-ownership and fair business practice. His professional career has given him opportunities to work with health research, renewable energy, and community projects.

Garett hopes to provide experiences for others that allow them to engage with stories in a very personal way, allowing an opportunity for event participants to change their perspectives on life.
